Am Ali, and I’m currently a PF student.  
I’m learning the basics of programming and slowly building my skills.  
Right now, I’m exploring C language and problem-solving techniques.  
I created this repo to practice Git and GitHub for my lab work.  
Apart from coding, I like playing chess and cricket in free time.
